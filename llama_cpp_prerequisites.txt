The build failed because the `llama_cpp` library requires `libclang` and a C/C++ toolchain to be installed on your system.

The error message indicates: "couldn't find any valid shared libraries matching: ['clang.dll', 'libclang.dll'], set the `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable to a path where one of these files can be found (invalid: [])"

To proceed with Llama.cpp integration, please install `libclang` and a C/C++ toolchain.

*   **On Windows:** You typically install the "Desktop development with C++" workload in Visual Studio Installer, which includes MSVC and the Windows SDK. You might also need to install LLVM/Clang separately and set the `LIBCLANG_PATH` environment variable to its `bin` directory.
*   **On Linux:** Install `clang` and `build-essential` (or equivalent) using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install clang build-essential`).
*   **On macOS:** Install Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).

Once these prerequisites are installed, please let me know, and I will try to build the project again.
